# Summary: **What to do before this synchronous session**

## eternal september 
:white_check_mark: **Read the following post.**
* ***[eternal september of the digital humanities by Bethany Nowviskie](http://nowviskie.org/2010/eternal-september-of-the-digital-humanities/)***
* How does the author discuss communities of practice in DH? 
* How have they changed for her? What is your experience with them? 
* What do you think about the ‘eternal September’ metaphor? 
* *What does it mean to practice as digital humanist?* 

# Failure and DH tools: It's not working!  
* :white_check_mark: Watch the video *or* read the text of this talk *"It Doesn't Work:" Failure and DH Tools"* by Quinn Dombrowski. 
* "But let’s first talk about DH tools, and the ways they "don’t work." One thing I’ve learned, over my years of doing direct end-user support, is that — what it is that “doesn’t work” often depends on your perspective." 
* "Navigating technical documentation, and instructions not written with your particular perspective in mind, are skills you develop over time."  
    * ["It Doesn't Work:" Failure and DH Tools *(video)*](https://univr.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2b012f49-5821-411f-bbb3-abf800f3eb54)

###  We will be using the frameworks from Nowviskie & Dombrowski to frame our synchronous discussion on how to search for tools.

## :white_check_mark: What are the types of tools available?
* What is it you are trying to do? Does a tool exist for your particular need?  
* **Activity:** If we look at a website for a particular tool, what assumptions did the tools' designers make about what users are trying to do?  
    * [Choose from this list of tools from Duke.](https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/tools) 
    * Select one of the tools to consider its possibilities.
        * What does it do?  
        * How does it do it? 
        * What was it designed for? 
        * How might it be limited? 
        * How might we expand past those limitations?
