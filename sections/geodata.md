# Tools for mapping 
* What kinds of data are you working with? 
* Defining geospatial data.
* There are many tools for working with geospatial data. What is your end goal? 
* Is it important to your project that you analyze your data (processing and/or manipulating your data)? Or do you just want to create a map/visualization (presentation of your data)?

## What is geospatial data?
* ["Spatial literacy is the competent and confident use of maps, mapping, and spatial thinking to address ideas, situations, and problems within daily life, society, and the world around us.](https://www.smu.edu/libraries/fondren/services/gis) 
    * Diana Stuart Sinton, Cornell University & Executive Director of the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS)
* What does [GPS](https://www.gps.gov/) stand for?
* Who uses Geospatial Data?
* "...geographic data is data with implicit or explicit reference to a location relative to the Earth." [via Geolexica](https://www.geolexica.org/concepts/202/)
* Why would it matter to me in the humanities?

## When do you choose to use a DH tool or programming?
In this session we are building on what we discussed in the previous data session.
* What assumptions have been built into the tool you are considering?
* How does it read your data? What kinds of data (metadata, administrative, geospatial) is it looking at?  
* How does a DH tool create a visualization? 
* For today's lesson, our goal is *to make a map.* 

## Determining what tool you need for your project
* A tool for mapping: [Storymaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)
    * [Create A Rich Multimedia Narrative with ESRI Story Maps By Olivia Ildefonso, GC Digital Fellow](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=581c9883c9fa4bab8f8048eaa130a813)
* A tool for  data viz: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)
* A tool for geospatial analysis: [ARC-GIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview)
    * ARC-GIS contains data *sources*, allows for *processing and analysis* of that data, and you can use it to create an presentation layer or *output* of maps.
