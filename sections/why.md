* *What does it mean to practice as digital humanist?* 

# Failure and DH tools: It's not working!  
* :white_check_mark: Watch the video *or* read the text of this talk *"It Doesn't Work:" Failure and DH Tools"* by Quinn Dombrowski.
* "But let’s first talk about DH tools, and the ways they “don’t work”. One thing I’ve learned, over my years of doing direct end-user support, is that — what it is that “doesn’t work” often depends on your perspective." 
* "Navigating technical documentation, and instructions not written with your particular perspective in mind, are skills you develop over time."
