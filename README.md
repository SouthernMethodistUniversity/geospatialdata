# Digital Projects, Research and Tools

We have been discussing different aspects and stages of digital scholarship projects. In this session we will discuss how you can find and assess tools.  

## Required before session
**Read the following post.**
* We will use this a a frame for our discussion
* ***[eternal september of the digital humanities by Bethany Nowviskie](http://nowviskie.org/2010/eternal-september-of-the-digital-humanities/)***
* How does the author discuss communities of practice in DH? How have they changed for her? What is your experience with them? What do you think about the ‘eternal September’ metaphor? *What does it mean to practice as digital humanist?* 


## Broadly, you may have goals around: 
### Sources: What data or other materials do you want to analyze?
* Digital Humanities and data
* Acquiring, cleaning, and creating data
* Identifying the differences between unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.
* Distinguishing between different file types, their definitions, and applications.
* Applying intellectual property rights to the downloading and sharing of data.
* Practicing different ways of downloading or creating data.

### Processing: How can these resources/materials be analyzed or prepared for analysis?
* The Command Line (Python)
* Working with Tools (openrefine, Voyant)

### Presenting: How do you want to share your sources and your findings?

## Goals: What is it you want to do?
* Where are you in the process? 
* Your goals and your constraints (limitations of time, money, expertise, etc.) will dictate your choices (topics, training, partners, tools, programming, etc.)

* In this example from Programming Historian, you can see how lessons fall into broad phases or categories.
